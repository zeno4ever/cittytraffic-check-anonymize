# citytraffic-check-anonymize
Test how good the 'Citytraffic' methode is to keep your mac private

As far I (Dave Borghuis) can follow the steps of CittyTrafic :

  MAC --> SHA256 --> first 17 characters

Especially the last step is unclear, what data is removed to go from 64 characters to 17 characters. For this test I asume that only the left 17 characters of the sha265 is used.
